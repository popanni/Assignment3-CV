# Pytorch-CNN for image classification.
Implement Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification models. The goals of this assignment are as follows:
• Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
• Understand and be able to implement modular backpropagation
• Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
• Implement Batch Normalization for training deep networks
• Implement Dropout to regularize networks
• Understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get
practice with training these models on data
